## GamePlay Walkthrough: 
Let _Partner1 Name_ be **PlayerOne** and _Partner2 Name_ be **PlayerTwo**
+ Remove the common characters from **PlayerOne** and **PlayerTwo**:
	+ Here removed common characters are **(p, l, a, y, e, r, o)**
+ Count characters which are left **(n, e, t, w) = 4**
+ Here, **FLAMES count = 4** 
	+	Then we start count from left up to flames count 4. Then remove the letter which at the position 4.  Here, it is **'M'**. So the letters become:  
FLA~~M~~ES -->   **_FLAES_** 
	+ Then we start count again after from the letter which is removed ie, from **'E'**. So the next character to remove is **'L'**. So our letters become:  
F~~L~~AES --> **FAES**  
After next step:  
~~F~~AES --> **AES**  
Then:  
~~A~~ES --> **ES**  
Last:  
~~E~~S --> **E**  
So the result is '**Enemy**'.
